            About me</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: medium;">
            I&#39;m a final year student at the North-west University who loves building web applications. Due to graduate in 2022, I have acquired technical knowledge and skills from my course. I have used a range of programming languages, operating systems and development tools. I love working and interacting with people and I&#39;m always keen to learning new things. I am passionate about technology and I am keen to develop as a graduate trainee in software development.

            I&#39;m a multi-talented person who is originally from Soweto. I&#39;am a fast learner and I love learning new things as they help me pick up new skills along the way. I have this strong belief that in order to achieve difficult projects and tasks, you have to work with other people and you have to bring in their skills and experiences. I am also very good at working under pressure. </p>
